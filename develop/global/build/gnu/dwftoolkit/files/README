Setup:

$/dwfcore -             the project root for the GNU make system as well as the KDevelop project
$/dwfcore/src -         the start of the source tree for the project
$/dwfcore/src/dwfcore - a SYMBOLIC LINK to the real source base at $/Bianchi/develop/global/src/dwfcore

Depending on how you got your distribution this link might be missing or broken, please confirm its existance and create it if necessary.

Within each of the real source code folders are two files that MUST NOT BE DELETED:
    Makefile.in
    Makefile.am

If configure fails with:
    permission denied or similar - chmod +x ./configure
    already configured; run 'make distclean' - but you can't and seem stuck forever, rm config.status


Build notes:

There are two build configurations:
debug - enables full debugging and no optimization
optimized - O2 level optimizations plus others, for a more finely tuned build, try -march=pentium4 (e.g.)

ZLIB - by default, libdwfcore is built using the system zlib. there is an internal zlib that can be turned on by defining -DDWFCORE_BUILD_ZLIB.  If defined, the -lz LDFLAG must be removed.


libdwfcore will be installed to /usr/local/lib by default
and header will be installed to /usr/local/include/dwfcore by default.


Read the INSTALL file.
After installing libdwfcore, you may need to run ldconfig before linking.
use libtool to link against the shared library simply by adding -ldwfcore to your LDFLAGS

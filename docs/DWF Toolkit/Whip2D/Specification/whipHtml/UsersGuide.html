<p><a NAME="Overview"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Introduction</font></font></b>

<p>What is WHIP! data? WHIP! data is the new name given to classic DWF (Design Web Format) 
files of version 0.55 and earlier.  WHIP! data was developed because widely accepted 2D vector 
file standards did not address the needs of Internet aware applications. In addition, commercial 
formats were too closely tied to specific proprietary data structures to support the exchange of 
illustrations among systems.  
<p>WHIP! data is a format for the standardized description of 2D, vector-based drawings and 
illustrations, intended for encapsulation within a DWF package file. <b>WHIP! data files of version 
6.0 and greater are not intended to be used as stand-alone files, but rather a data channel within 
a DWF package file.</b> The DWF 6 format is described in detail in the <b>DWF Specification</b> 
document accompanying this distribution. See also the <b>DWF Toolkit</b> document.
<p>The WHIP! toolkit is a set of C++ classes that accept drawing calls from
an application and convert, "<a NAME="serialize"></a>serialize," them into
a WHIP! data stream. The toolkit also performs the inverse operation of reading
a WHIP! data stream and converting, "<a NAME="materializing"></a>materializing,"
it back into a set of objects suitable for hooking up to drawing calls in a rendering
application.  WHIP! data is described in detail in the <b>WHIP! Data Specification</b>
document accompanying this distribution. 
<p>By abstraction, the toolkit is not dependent upon any particular operating 
system or graphics API and instead requires the application to supply low-level 
"<a NAME="glue"></a>glue" code for input/output functionality and graphics handling.
<p>This guide does not fully describe all of the classes and functions of the WHIP! Toolkit. 
Instead, this is intended only to be a basic orientation and overview of the toolkit. 
<p><a NAME="Toolc"></a><b><font size=+1>Toolkit Conventions</font></b>
<p>There are some basic toolkit conventions:
<ol>
    <li>
    All toolkit class names and type definitions begin with the identifier
    WT_...(originally, for <u>W</u>HIP! <u>T</u>oolkit) to prevent name collisions with other applications.
    <li>
    All toolkit definitions and constants begin with the identifier <font face="Courier New">WD_</font>...
    (originally, for <u>W</u>HIP! <u>D</u>efinition)to prevent name collisions.
    <li>
    The most common type definitions are contained in the header file <i>%whipcore.h</i>.
    <li>
    Any application file that uses the toolkit should include the header file
    <i>whip_toolkit.h</i>.
</ol>


<a NAME="SettingUp"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Setting up to use the WHIP! Toolkit</font></font></b>

<P>The WHIP! toolkit is distributed in source code form.  You have to build the libraries yourself.
The two primary usage scenarios are static libraries and dynamic link libraries (DLLs).  (Note, 
we primarily use static libraries in-house to minimize the deployment footprint of products using 
the toolkit, and to avoid DLL conflicts.)</P>

<ol>
    <li>
    <b>Static Libraries</b>
    <p>For VC7, open the whiptool.sln solution file. For VC6, open the whiptool_vc6.dsw workspace.
    Build the configuration you desire.  Several different configuration types have been 
    provided for you in VC7, such as a full blown read/write library, a static runtime or
    a DLL runtime, or a reader-only library.  Only full-blown read/write library configurations
    have been provided in VC6.
    <p>You can control "how much" goes into the WHIP! library through the CODE_NOT_WANTED 
    preprocessor macro.  You can "turn off" the writing code so that it's not built into the 
    library.  <i>Note, the toolkit has not been instrumented to remove reading code.</i>  See 
    %whipcore.h for the exact values, but as an example, if you set CODE_NOT_WANTED=0x20000000 
    in your configuration, the WHIP! output code would not be built into the library.
    <p>Regardless of the configuration you choose, there are some things you need to setup in your
    application project in order to link to the WHIP! toolkit:
    <UL>
        <LI>Code generation (runtime): Static Library or MultiThreaded DLL (debug and release respectively,)
            depending on the configuration selected.
        <LI>Preprocessor settings: add the constant WHIP_STATIC_LIB
        <LI>Include path: add "global\\inc"  
        <LI>Linker, input: add WhipTk.lib and zlib.lib
        <LI>Linker, input: You may need to also ignore the LIBCMT / LIBCMTD library as well.
        <LI>Linker, path: add "global\\lib\\debug" and "global\\lib\\release" to your debug and 
        release targets, respectively.
        <LI>Source code.  Include "whip_toolkit.h" in your precompiled header or at the top of 
        your source files.
    </UL>

    <br>

    <li>
    <b>Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs)</b>
    <p>For VC7 and VC6, the whiptool.sln and whiptool_vc6.sln solution/workspace (respectively)
    also contain configuratinos / projects for building the WHIP! toolkit as a DLL.  Build the 
    configuration you desire.  Only debug and release configurations have been created in the 
    solution and workspace.  These are full-blown read/write configurations.
    <p>You can control "how much" goes into the WHIP! library through the CODE_NOT_WANTED 
    preprocessor macro.  You can "turn off" the writing code so that it's not built into the 
    library.  <i>Note, the toolkit has not been instrumented to remove reading code.</i>  See 
    %whipcore.h for the exact values, but as an example, if you set CODE_NOT_WANTED=0x20000000 
    in your configuration, the WHIP! output code would not be built into the library.

        <LI>Code generation (runtime): MultiThreaded DLL (debug and release respectively.)
        <LI>Include path: add "global\\inc"
        <LI>Linker, input: whiptkDll.lib, zlibDll.lib.
        <LI>Linker, input: You may need to also ignore the LIBCMT / LIBCMTD library as well.
        <LI>Linker, path: add "global\\bin\\debug" and "global\\bin\\release" to your debug and 
        release targets, respectively.  (Note the difference with respect to the static library 
        paths - when built, the DLL import libraries live alongside their DLLs.)
        <LI>Source code.  Include "whip_toolkit.h" in your precompiled header or at the top
        of your source files.

<a NAME="Writ"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Writing WHIP! data</font></font></b>
<p>Of the many classes and methods in the WHIP! Toolkit, you only need to
understand a small set in order to generate WHIP! data. For
simplicity the toolkit is designed such that almost every option and setting
has a usable default value.
<p>The process for writing a WHIP! data includes these steps:
<ol>
    <li>
    Creating an instance of the <tt><a href="#WT_File"> WT_File </a></tt> class.

    <li>
    Optionally providing the created <tt>WT_File</tt> object with a set of
    application supplied input and output handler routines, called "action"
    routines. 

        <blockquote>
        If no action routines are supplied by the application, the <tt>WT_File</tt>
        object uses a default set of C++ standard file input/output routines (<tt>fopen</tt>,
        <tt>fwrite</tt>,
        <tt>fclose</tt>,
        and so forth). An need for areplacing these I/O functions would be when
        an application seeks input from a stream (i.e. an IStream from an Internet session)
        rather than from a file.
        <p>The phrase "<a NAME="ActionRoutine"></a>action routine" is defined
        as any application replaceable toolkit function, but more typically refers to those
        routines which perform file I/O and object/drawable/attribute processing. Every action 
        routine has a default action, a procedure, that is inside the toolkit. An application
        can override this default action by passing the toolkit a pointer to an
        application-specific procedure that should be called instead.
        </blockquote>

    <li>
    Optionally specifying heuristics to the <tt>WT_File</tt> object to instruct
    it in what style the WHIP! data should be written.

        <blockquote>
        Example heuristics that can be specified include: whether the toolkit
        should perform data compression of the WHIP! data, whether the toolkit should
        output a readable ASCII WHIP! data or more compact binary WHIP! data, 
        or whether the toolkit should transform the vertices of objects before
        recording them to the WHIP! data.
        <p>If no heuristics are specified, a default set of heuristics is used.
        These defaults are documented individually under each opcode in the WHIP!
        Specification document included with this distribution.
        </blockquote>

    <li>
    Setting the drawing attributes (drawable color, line weight, visibility,
    and so forth) to the state desired for the next drawable (a geometric primitive
    such as a line, a triangle, a circle, and so forth) that is about to be
    recorded to the file.

        <blockquote>The state of these drawing attributes is contained in the grouping
        class <tt>WT_Rendition. </tt>The <tt>WT_File</tt> object contains two instances
        of this <tt>WT_Rendition</tt> class: one instance that holds the <i>desired</i>
        attribute state for the next drawable, and one instance for the <i>actual</i>
        state of the attributes as has been previously written to the file. When
        the <tt>WT_File</tt> object is initially created, both the desired rendition
        and the actual rendition hold the default values for each attribute. 
        <p>The application using the toolkit only modifies the attribute settings
        contained in the <i>desired</i> rendition. When a drawable is written to
        the file, the toolkit automatically updates the <i>actual</i> rendition,
        as well as the file contents, with only those attributes that have changed
        and those that the drawable cares about. For example, triangles don't care
        about the "<a NAME="marker size"></a>marker size" attribute. The overall
        effect is to minimize the WHIP! data size by only storing attribute
        changes that are absolutely necessary.
        <p>Generally, WHIP! data writers interact only with the <i>desired</i> rendition,
        whereas WHIP! data readers interact only with the <i>actual</i> rendition.
        </blockquote>

    <li>
    Recording "<a NAME="drawables"></a>drawables" (geometric primitives) to
    the file.

        <blockquote>To do this an application tessellates the objects in its own private
        database and converts them into geometric primitives that the toolkit understands.
        The application does this by creating instances of toolkit drawables 
        (see \ref groupDrawable "Drawable objects"), such as the <tt>WT_Polyline</tt>, 
        <tt>WT_Polymarker</tt>, and the <tt>WT_Polytriangle</tt> classes. Each of these 
        objects has its own "<tt>serialize</tt>" method which records any needed 
        attributes and the drawable itself into the WHIP! data. The process of setting 
        the desired attribute state and of serializing drawables repeats for each 
        geometric primitive that the application wishes to record.
        </blockquote>

    <li>
    When all drawables have been serialized, the "<tt>close</tt>" method of
    the <tt>WT_File</tt> object is called, after which the <tt>WT_File</tt>
    object may be deleted (or allowed to go out of scope.)


    <a NAME="Validation"></a><b><font size=+1>Validation</font></b>
    <p>The WHIP! Toolkit does not validate return values from the underlying
    code operations. It is the responsibly of each developer to perform all
    necessary validation for their application.
    <p><a NAME="Simp"></a><b><font size=+1>A Simple Example of a WHIP! Data Writing
    Application</font></b>

    <p>To demonstrate the simplicity of using the toolkit, the following program
    and notes are included on storing a single line into WHIP! data:

    \ex SingleLine.cpp

    <a NAME="Notes:"></a><b>Notes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Line 0 defines all of the WHIP! Toolkit classes and constants for use by
        the application.

        <li>
        Line 8 creates the main <tt>WT_File</tt> object instance that is used by
        almost every other toolkit function.

        <li>
        Line 10 tells the file object what filename should be used when creating
        the new WHIP! data file, which will be passed in turn to the low-level
        input/output routines.

        <li>
        Line 11 tells the file object that the application will be writing to the
        named file.

        <li>
        Line 12 indirectly instructs the low-level input/output routines to open
        and ready the file for output. Since we have not defined any action routines,
        the built-in default I/O action routines will be used. Note that these
        default action routines utilize <tt>fopen</tt>, which only handles ASCII
        file names. For file names with wide characters, substitute the following
        for Line 12:

        <blockquote><code>
        FILE *my_whip_file_pointer=NULL;<br>
        my_whip_file_pointer = (FILE*)_wfopen(myfile.filename(),<br>
        myfile.set_stream_user_data(my_whip_file_pointer);
        </code>
        </blockquote>

        <li>
        Lines 15 and 16 overrides the default color and sets the color so that
        the subsequent drawables will be drawn in red. Mapped colors are used in the 
        example; however RGB and RGBA colors are also supported.

        <li>
        Line 17 and 18 create an instance of a toolkit line (a <tt>WT_Polyline</tt>).

        <li>
        Line 19 causes the line to be added to the file.

        <li>

<a NAME="Read"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Reading WHIP! Data</font></font></b>

        replacing these I/O functions occurs when the application wants to get input 
        from the Internet rather than from a file.
        </blockquote>

    <li>
    Optionally specifying heuristics to the <tt>WT_File</tt> object to instruct
    it how the WHIP! data should be read in.

        <blockquote>For example, an heuristic that could be specified includes whether
        the toolkit should transform the vertices of objects as they are read from
        the WHIP! data. If no heuristics are specified, a default set of heuristics
        is used. 
        </blockquote>

    <li>
    Replacing the desired&nbsp;<a NAME="action"></a>action routines of those
    toolkit objects that the application cares about.

        <blockquote>Each object in the toolkit (either a drawable object or an attribute
        object) has a&nbsp;<a NAME="materialize"></a><tt>materialize</tt> method
        and a&nbsp;<a NAME="process"></a><tt>process</tt> method. Normally when
        WHIP! data is read, each object in the file is first materialized
        (parsed) and then its <tt>process</tt> method is called. The default "process"
        action for attribute objects is to update their value in the <tt>WT_File</tt>
        object's current rendition. The default process action for drawables is
        to do nothing.
        <p>Normally an application using the toolkit does not change the "process"
        action routines for attribute objects, but&nbsp; specifies process routines
        for those drawable objects it cares about. When the toolkit reads, decodes,
        materializes, and processes a drawable, the application's action routine
        is called with the object at which time the application could convert and
        store the drawable into its own private database <b><i>—</i></b> such as
        a display list.

    Calling the <tt>WT_File</tt> object's; <tt>process_next_object()</tt>

    method reads the next opcode from the WHIP! data, creates an object
    instance, materializes the object, and calls the appropriate action routine
    to process the object.

    <li>
    When all drawables have been materialized and processed, the <tt>close</tt>
    method of the <tt>WT_File</tt> object is called, after which the <tt>WT_File</tt>

<B>NOTE, THE FOLLOWING BLOCKREF FUNTIONALITY HAS BEEN DEPRECATED IN VERSION 6.0 AND 
IS MENTIONED HERE ONLY FOR LEGACY COMPATABILITY.</B>

<p><a NAME="WT_FileBlcks"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>%WT_File
&amp; Blocks - <i>DEPRECATED</i></font></font></b>
<p>The <tt><a href="#WT_File"> WT_File </a></tt> WHIP! Toolkit class for writing
and reading WHIP! data provides three additional modes for opening
WHIP! data with version 0.55.&nbsp; Version 0.50 or lesser
toolkit releases were originally supporting reading and writing WHIP! data content
as opcodes. Version 0.55 supports reading and writing
WHIP! data contents not only as opcodes but also as blocks.
<p>Basically, a group of opcodes represents a block. There are 14 different
types of blocks that are possible in WHIP! data. For more detailed
information on blocks, see the WHIP! Specification's description of the <b>BlockRef</b>
opcode (implemented via WT_BlockRef). Each block will be preceded by a <b>BlockRef</b> which 
holds some meta-data pertaining to the kind of block it represents or references.
The following 3 fragments of code illustrate the block mode of writing,
reading, and appending WHIP! data contents.

<blockquote>
    <p><a NAME="WritgDWFContBlks"></a><b><font size=+1>Writing WHIP! Data
    Content as Blocks - <i>DEPRECATED</i></font></b>
    <p>To write WHIP! data content as blocks, open WHIP! data in <tt>Block_Write</tt>
    mode and invoke the <tt>write_block</tt> api after setting the appropriate
    <tt>WT_BlockRef</tt> rendition attribute to signal the beginning of a new block.
    <p>This first example shows the writing of WHIP! data content as blocks. Assume
    in this example that the WHIP! data files <i>c:\\test1.dwf</i> and
    <i>c:\\test2.dwf</i> already exist. Also, suppose that we want to merge those 
    files to WHIP! data files as different blocks in a single WHIP! data file with 
    <i>c:\\test.dwf</i>, the first file, as an embedded font block and the second 
    file as an overlay block. The following fragment of code illustrates how this 
    is done:

    \ex WriteBlocks.cpp

    <p>The following code fragment explains how to write a blocked file containing
    only redline information:

    \ex WriteRedline.cpp

</blockquote>


<blockquote>
    <p><a NAME="ReadDWFContBlks"></a><b><font size=+1>Reading through WHIP! Data Content
    as Blocks - <i>DEPRECATED</i></font></b>
    <p>To read through WHIP! data content as blocks, open the WHIP! data file in
    <tt>Block_Read</tt>
    mode and loop through all the <b>BlockRefs</b> (contained as part of directory);
    then, invoke the <tt>read_block</tt> api passing in <b>BlockRefs</b> one
    by one.
    <p>The second code example attempts to read the WHIP! data contents as blocks
    using the
    <tt>Block_Read</tt> file mode. Assume that <i>c:\\test.dwf</i>
    already exists and it is a WHIP! data file versioned 0.55. Also
    assume that <i>c:\\test.dwf</i> has its contents grouped as blocks with
    a valid block directory towards the end. Then the following code fragment
    attempts to open the WHIP! data file in <tt>Block_Read</tt> mode and extracts
    two blocks in to two different WHIP! data file — <i>c:\\test1.dwf</i> contains

    <p>To append overlay blocks to existing WHIP! data, open the WHIP! data 
    in <tt>Block_Append</tt> mode and invoke the <tt>write_block</tt>
    api after setting the appropriate <tt>WT_BlockRef</tt> rendition attribute to
    signal the beginning of the new overlay block.
    <p>The third fragment of code, following, best illustrates the usage of
    opening WHIP! data in <tt>Block_Append</tt> mode. The new information
    is appended to existing WHIP! data by opening the <tt>WT_File</tt>
    object in <tt>Block_Append</tt>. Assuming that <i>c:\\test1.dwf</i> and
    <i>c:\\test2.dwf</i> already exist and are valid WHIP! data files and 
    version == 0.55, the following code attempts to append the contents of 
    <i>c:\\test2.dwf</i> to <i>c:\\test1.dwf</i> as a new overlay block.

    <p><a NAME="DirectryBlocks"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Directory Opcode &amp; Blocks - <i>DEPRECATED</i></font></b>
    <p>Directory information is written automatically by the WHIP! Toolkit for version 0.55 data.
    As the <tt>WT_BlockRef</tt> rendition attribute changes, <b>BlockRefs</b> are serialized in WHIP! data 
    and are automatically accumulated in the toolkit as part of the <tt>m_directory</tt>
    member variable of the <tt><a href="#WT_File"> WT_File </a></tt> toolkit
    object. Towards the end, when the WHIP! data closes, directory information
    is serialized with proper file offset and block size information for all
    <b>BlockRefs</b>.
